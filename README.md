#pearson-dictionary-polymer

Polymer components and example program using the Pearson Dictionary API.

##Demo Application
You will need to put your API key in the ```dict-list.html``` file. Run ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` in the project folder, and navigate to ```localhost:8000```.

Type in a headword, and it will display ten results from the "ldoce5" dictionary API.

##Attribution
The structure of this repository pulls heavily from the Polymer tutorial. Much of the styling remains similar/the same.
